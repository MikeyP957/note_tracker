# note_tracker

## Overview
This application is an example of a simple note taker that takes in user information and then saves and displays the user input on the webpage. The back end of this app uses Express.js to retrieve and update data from a json file. The front end code fetches this data and displays it on the notes page. 

## Usage
When the user opens the page they are presented with a loading page that links to the notes page where they can view and update notes to the page. Writing and saving can easily be done by first typing into the designated input containers (title and message), and then clicking the save icon found in the top right of the page. The new notes title will then be displayed in the right hand column of the notes page. To view the note message the user must click on the desired note and then the full message will be displayed.
